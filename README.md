# TwiBooks #

So just to try out how easy it is to convert something from the Web to
iBooks 2 I made this thing. It uses twitterjs as described in
http://remysharp.com/2007/05/18/add-twitter-to-your-blog-step-by-step/
and is based on Apple's HelloWorld dashboard example widget. I just
clicked a couple of buttons and I got an iBook.
